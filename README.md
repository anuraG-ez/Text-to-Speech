- **Play Button**: Clicking the "Play" button triggers the conversion of the entered text into speech.
- **Language Selection**: The application supports different languages. Currently, it's set to Hindi (India), but you can easily change it to other languages by modifying the `lang` attribute in the code.
- **Responsive Design**: The application is designed to be responsive and works well on various screen sizes.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: Provides the structure and layout for the web application.
- **CSS3**: Used for styling and layout adjustments.
- **JavaScript**: Handles user interactions and integrates with the browser's Speech Synthesis API to convert text to speech.
